  Meeting #9: October 27, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  Ian, Nashir, and Michelle met in the morning to work on the plan for the outreach, finalize the website, and work on a draft of the proposal. A key part of the proposal score concerns the outreach associated with the project, and so Ian spent the day working on the first draft of the outreach for the proposal, helped to revise the outreach page on the website, and made a tentative draft of the overall budget (also required for the proposal). Nashir worked on the website at large, but focused on the outreach and contact pages, wrote the template of the letter of outreach, programmed the contact form on website (css, html, and need to finish the php).

  Meeting #8: October 26, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  Alex and Michelle met up in the morning the finalize the design of the EVA camera attachment mechanism. Michelle contacted a Digital Arts professor from her school who was willingly to print our design on the school’s 3D printer. Also she talked to the Dean of Technology and Engineering to help machine a metal rod that is threaded internally in opposite direction and two tapped cylinders for our design. Nashir, Ian, Patrick arrived later to help work on the proposal. To maximize efficiency, Nashir helped divide up different tasks to individual team members to work on for the proposal. We worked with Unbounded to film short bio’s for social media for outreach. Michelle worked on the first draft of the letter of funding and Ian, Nashir, and Patrick helped edit it. In addition, Ian worked on the budget for the letter of funding and Nashir wrote the letter of institutional of intent. The team came up with an acronym of our product name, CLaMP: Camera, Locking, and, Mounting, Positioning System.

  Nashir and Ian met up to discuss future plans for the website. Exciting plans to come in terms of overall concept and design. Both working hard to ensure that the site effectively communicates who we are as a company and as a team. Afterwards, Michelle and Alex joined in and worked on assigning the last tasks that we need for the proposal.

  Meeting #6: October 19, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  We met up today to discuss some final preparations for our proposal. Unbounded Media was there to livestream and record our discussion. We were able to finalize the final overall concept of the design such as how we were going to grasp onto the different sections on the ISS. Overall, it was a very productive meeting in terms of understanding that our team, although small, was doing as much or even more work than other teams.
  We discussed the outreach opportunity and created an outline in order to effectively plan each outreach event/activity. This led to planning a multitude of institutions to go to in order to have effective outreach ideas for the upcoming year. This meeting definitely solidified Quintessence as a company and not just a project group. We are working towards such a bigger goal than trying to design a tool.

  Meeting #5: October 12, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  From our GoFundMe page, we made a surplus of our budget. We thanks all of the donors on our website. We brainstormed ideas on ways to lock in the position on the stanchion. We made a compliance matrix to decide what fastening mechanism we wanted to use to lock in the position on the stanchion. We ended up going with the locking cam because it ensured security. We also discussed about about finding additional funding for the team. We planned to talk to our school about Micro- G NExT.

  Meeting #4: October 6, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  In our fourth meeting, we brainstorm ideas about how we going to design the stanchion part of our project. We decided to make modular pieces with different heights so that the heights can be adjusted accordingly. In addition, we discussed about how we were going to fund our project. Collectively, we decided to set up a GoFundMe page to reach out to our friends, family, and schools. We took team photos for the website and our GoFundMe page. Nashir helped set up the GoFundMe page and we decided he would be the financial advisor for the team. Also, Alex sketched and assembled our first draft of our design, including, the screw clamp and the stanchion with the GoPro attachment on SolidWorks. We put a video of the screw clamp design on SolidWorks on our GoFundMe page. We scheduled to meet the following Saturday to brainstorm ideas for the locking mechanism for our project.

  Meeting #3: September 29, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  In our third meeting, we brainstorm ideas for the positioning system of our design. We focused on the pitch and yaw aspect of the design. After doing thorough research and looking at different objects with a pitch and yaw layout, we decide on a few that would be best for our design and  created a compliance table. After carefully deliberating our choices, we decide to go with 2 axis arrangement where there are two independent axises for the pitch and yaw for the camera to move. We set another meeting for the following Saturday to discuss and brainstorm about how we going to design the stanchion part of the project.

  Meeting #2: September 22, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  After spending the week brainstorming possible ideas for the design prototype, we brought in objects, gadgets, and sketches that could potentially help us with our design. We took apart the objects and gadget to see how they worked. After we analyzed the deconstructed parts, we outlined how we wanted to design our EVA camera attachment mechanism. The first part of the design we tackled was the locking or attachment system. We made a compliance matrix to decide what clamps we wanted to use for our design. From this, we decided to use the screw clamp because of its strong and secure properties. Also, Nashir started the first draft to our team’s website and we worked on the letter of intent. Due to work schedules, we ended our meeting right after finalizing the attachment system design and set another meeting on the following Saturday to come up with the mount and positioning system.

  Meeting #1: September 15, 2018
</h2>
<p>
  In our first meeting, we discussed the challenge we would attempt. In addition, we exchanged schedules and phone numbers. Michelle created a group chat on discord so that everyone in the group would be able to contact each other during the project. We decided to take on challenge #2: EVA camera attachment mechanism.

    Alex, Ian, Michelle, Nashir, and Patrick met during NASA's National Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS) Program, an educational and professional experience designed to give community college students an opportunity to learn about NASA's historical and emergent technological prowess. They participated in a 5 week online class comprised of readings, multimedia, and quizzes discussing the past and present exploration of Mars (the human exploration of Mars in particular), the international space station, how NASA spacecraft and systems are used to study and protect the Earth, the solar system and beyond, as well as aeronautical engineering. The course culminated in a final project related to NASA's "Journey to Mars". Their final projects were varied; Alex designed a rover, Patrick, Michelle, and Nashir wrote essays discussing and analyzing the Evolvable Mars Campaign, and Ian planned a human mission campaign to Mars. As some of the top students in the online course, they were selected for the onsite experience, where they worked on 10-person teams competing under the direction of NASA Engineers & Scientists using the Mindstorms EV3 to build and program a Mars Rover to run autonomously on a mock Martian landscape.
    <br />
    <br />

    Upon completion of the workshop, they received an email sent by the NCAS coordinators about the <a href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/about-micro-g-next.cfm">Micro-G NExT design challenge</a>. They are addressing challenge #2; per the official documentation: "Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), or spacewalks, on the International Space Station (ISS) are currently viewed through cameras mounted on the astronauts’ suits. There is a desire to have another view of the EVA tasks from a separate camera that the astronauts can carry with them and attach to the ISS exterior nearby their worksite. The camera will need to be attached to a stanchion that allows for clocking and adjustability of the camera angle. Since the tasks performed on EVAs are different and take place in a different location each time, the stanchion will need the ability to attach to different interfaces. These interfaces include ISS handrails, the ISS truss segment frame, and the CETA cart square grid."
